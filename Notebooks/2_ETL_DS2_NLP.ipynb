    "According to the [documentation](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment), this is the interpretation of the scoring:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ``compound`` score is computed by summing the valence scores of each word in the lexicon, adjusted according to the rules, and then normalized to be between -1 (most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive). This is the most useful metric if you want a single unidimensional measure of sentiment for a given sentence. Calling it a 'normalized, weighted composite score' is accurate. \n",
    " \n",
    "  It is also useful for researchers who would like to set standardized thresholds for classifying sentences as either positive, neutral, or negative.  \n",
    "  Typical threshold values (used in the literature cited on this page) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **positive sentiment**: ``compound`` score >=  0.05\n",
    "  - **neutral  sentiment**: (``compound`` score > -0.05) and (``compound`` score < 0.05)\n",
    "  - **negative sentiment**: ``compound`` score <= -0.05\n",
    " \n",
    "  **NOTE:** The ``compound`` score is the one most commonly used for sentiment analysis by most researchers, including the authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ``pos``, ``neu``, and ``neg`` scores are *ratios for proportions of text that fall in each category* (so these should all add up to be 1... or close to it with float operation).  These are the most useful metrics if you want to analyze the context & presentation of how sentiment is conveyed or embedded in rhetoric for a given sentence. For example, different writing styles may embed strongly positive or negative sentiment within varying proportions of neutral text -- i.e., some writing styles may reflect a penchant for strongly flavored rhetoric, whereas other styles may use a great deal of neutral text while still conveying a similar overall (compound) sentiment. As another example: researchers analyzing information presentation in journalistic or editorical news might desire to establish whether the proportions of text (associated with a topic or named entity, for example) are balanced with similar amounts of positively and negatively framed text versus being \"biased\" towards one polarity or the other for the topic/entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **IMPORTANTLY:** these proportions represent the \"raw categorization\" of each lexical item (e.g., words, emoticons/emojis, or initialisms) into positve, negative, or neutral classes; they **do not** account for the VADER rule-based enhancements such as word-order sensitivity for sentiment-laden multi-word phrases, degree modifiers, word-shape amplifiers, punctuation amplifiers, negation polarity switches, or contrastive conjunction sensitivity.\n"
